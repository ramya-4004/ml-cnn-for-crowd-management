# ml-cnn-for-crowd-management
to ensure Social Distacing is being followed , We have two approaches:-

1. Queue Management in - front of retail shops.

2.Crowd counting and liminting the no. of people at a tiem the stores.

If either of the two is being unfollowed , we plan to send a message to the shop owner / manager.
