# ml-cnn-for-crowd-management
To ensure Social Distancing is being followed , We have two approaches:-

1. Queue Management in - front of retail shops.

2.Crowd counting and liminting the no. of people at a time the stores.

If either of the two is being unfollowed , we plan to send a message to the shop owner / manager.

	Crowd checking is being done thru the files in the OUTSIDE_STORE.
	For testing we have used the video also included in the folder.
	Position Markers - Work In Progress(Not Reacting to the number of people in frame)
	So on temporary basis , have included some custom markers.
	END.
